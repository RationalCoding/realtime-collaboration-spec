# Client-Agnostic Realtime Collaboration for Programming
## Working Draft

### Editors:
Thomas Mullen

## Abstract
This document defines a set of APIs for implementing extensions to code editors/IDEs that are cross-compatible, performant and feature-rich.

This specification is **not** feature complete and is expected to be change significantly. Members of the community are highly encouraged to contribute to this document
.
A future test suite will be used to build an implementation report of the API.
