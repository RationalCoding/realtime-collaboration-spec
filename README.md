# Realtime Collaboration for Programming
## Working Draft

The current version of the specification can be found [here](https://github.com/RationalCoding/realtime-collaboration-spec/wiki).

This document defines a set of APIs for implementing code editor extensions that enable realtime collaboration between programmers (also known as pair-programming). The document is intended to standardize future implentations of these software and ensure implementations are cross-compatible, performant and feature-rich.

This specification is **not** feature complete and is expected to be change significantly. Members of the community are highly encouraged to contribute to this document.

A future test suite will be used to build an implementation report of the API.
